This is the Mist theme by theRealPadster (Padster).

Inspired by the look of the GDM3 login manager, the goal is to have a theme that is as fully transparent and out-of-the-way as possible. This means a panel that blends right into the desktop, simple flat, transparent buttons, and the bare minimum when it comes to menus and elements that overlap the workspace.

The theme works on GNOME-Shell 3.14, 3.16, 3.18, and 3.20; use whichever version you need.

There are a couple known minor bugs in the GNOME 3.14 version, which don't show up in the 3.16 version:
-Occasionally, a modal dialog will have a full black background instead of dimming
-The panel clock has no shadow until you first mouse over it
-The date label doesn't show up until the second time you open the calendar popup

If you have a fix for a bug, please share it with me so I can update it.
